                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>As Jen Simmons has so often stated in her podcast<a href="http://thewebahead.net/" class="link--white"> The Web Ahead</a>, I believe that any web project begins with good content oranized and structured with HTML. This helps to put the emphasis on content. Without it, you risk losing the focus of why users are actually accessing your product.</p>
                <p>Before any design is applied, I always write solid HTML.</p>

              <h2>CSS3</h2>
              <p>I use CSS every day. It's a great tool because of how well it works with HTML elements. CSS allows me to express my creativity in a way that is clean and intuitive for users on both mobile devices and more traditional desktop computers.</p>
              <h4>The Future?</h4>
              <p>Moving forward, I am excited to learn more about how <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" class="link--white">react.js</a> injects styles via javascript directly into HTML elements.</p>
              <p>To hear a balanced panal discussion about this, the guys over at The Shop Talk Show have this great <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/180-panel-on-inline-styles/" class="link--white">episode</a> of their podcast.</p>

            <div class="skills__info">
              <h2>SASS</h2>
              <p>Pre-processors in general have been great for CSS and while most have a similar feature set, I have found myself going back to SASS again and again, taking advantage of it's powerful mixins, extends, directives and it's ability to let you write in a nested format without it being compiled into nested CSS. Not having to worry about overly complex specifity, working in nested SASS helps me to visualize and write better modularized code.</p>
              <p>Be sure to checkout out <a href="http://sassmeister.com/" class="link--white">SassMeister</a>, an online text editor that lets you code in SASS and see the direct resulting CSS with no fuss. The more advanced the SASS you write, the more useful this tool is.</p>

            <div class="skills__info">
              <h2>JS / jQuery</h2>
              <p>To me, jQuery is a great UI and UX prototyping tool. Pair it with CSS animations, transitions or transforms and you can bring your designs to life. All my projects leverage this tool is some capacity.</p>
              <p>I also use Javascript to tag html elements with event tags to then track conversion in Google Analytics.</p>

              <h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
              <p>I've worked on a couple of Rails projects and am familiar with it's asset pipeline as well as it's erb templating system, and it's where I built my first living style-guide and pattern library.</p>

            <div class="skills__info">
              <h2>Wordpress</h2>
              <p>I have built a couple of custom wordpress themes by leveraging the power custom post types and custom post fields. While some developers have moved away from it, I find that it's still a viable and smart choice for many web projects that need a full-fledged CMS with a tried and tested admin dashboard.</p>

            <div class="skills__info">
              <h2>Sketch 3</h2>
              <p>I like starting in Sketch. Usually, I'll pick one module that needs to be built for a project that I think would look and feel great. Once I have that, I start looking at how I can alter it to make other design patterns and modules, constantly iterating until themes and motifs start to emerge and coalesce into an alpha style guide.</p> 
              <p>The resulting Sketch file then becomes my reference as I streamline and harmonize a style guide by using HTML, SASS and jQuery to design in the browser.</p>

              <h2>Photoshop</h2>
              <p>Photoshop is powerful and until the advent of Sketch by Boheiming Coding, it was the go to tool for web design. While I'm greatful for this ability of Photoshop, today in my workflow I leverage it for what it was built to be: a photo editor. I love the power and precision of Photoshop and I use it for all my photos.</p>
              <p>Also, because I have experience in the past with Flash, using Photoshop's timeline and keyframe animation interface, I'm able to make interesting animated Gifs.</p>

              <h2>Illustrator</h2>
              <p>I have been using illustrator for almost a decade, and love the pen tool in Illustrator. I find it's the best tool to use when creating logos and icons that need to be proportioned perfectly and completely symmetrical.</p>

              <h2>JIRA</h2>
              <p>I have used JIRA briefly on a couple of projects and love it. I have used other tools such as Asana and Trello, but for software and web projects, JIRA just makes sense. It has such a feature rich tool box and I love the 3rd party plugins and the ability to tie in JIRA to other applications. I'm definitely looking forward to using JIRA more in the future, especially in place of tools like Redmine.</p>

              <h2>Git</h2>
              <p>I use Git for all my projects. I can use it in the terminal or in a GUI such as Sourcetree, a piece of software I love. I had used SVN in the past, but can't see myself ever giving up Git for it.</p>

              <p>Grunt, Gulp and Broccoli are a definite must have for me. I don't need to use all three, but using one is a big tool for me in my workflow.</p>

            <p>All the lessons are interactive and were made in Apple's iWork Keynote, then converted into interactive .MOV files so that people on non-apple devices could play the lessons.</p>
            <p>Currently, I have stopped all development on these lesson plans as I am re-designing and rebuilding the website into a custom Wordpress theme that utilizes <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/" class="link--white">Reveal.js</a> a powerful Javascript framework that allows developers to create media-rich slide-decks that are responsive, and fast loading.</p>

              <p>More than anything, I built this ebook so that kids could see, read, touch and hear while learning English.

            <p>My program at Humber College was very intense. It was 9-5 Monday to Friday for 6 months and I learned many things.</p>
            <p>While I had had previous experience with web technologies, the sheer workload of the course helped me to hone these skills and manage tight timelines.</p>
            <p>The result?</p>
            <p>I became stronger and faster in all aspects of web development and it gave me the confidence to keep taking my skills to the next level.</p>
            <p>I am very proud to say that I finished at the top of my class and was offered a chance to come back and join the faculty and teach HTML and CSS to beginner level students.</p>
